# Neovim Configuration

### Init
Initialized with the NvChad distribution starter repo @ [d0c602f](https://github.com/NvChad/starter/tree/d0c602f5f155d4d1261609219e9b8a61e936d681)  
- The main nvchad repo (NvChad/NvChad) is used as a plugin by this repo.
- And it imports its modules , like `require "nvchad.options" , require "nvchad.mappings"`

### Changes
 - Created a `charlie` folder of custom user mappings and plugins in addition to NvChad defaults
 - Copy/pasted `nvchad.mappings` and disabled the import to more easily modify/remove default key mappings.
